## 🕵️ The Event Scraper - Our Event Detective

### What Is Scraping?

Imagine you have a giant bulletin board with hundreds of event posters. Your job is to:
1. Look at each poster
2. Write down: Event name, date, location, what it's about
3. Put all this info into a neat list

That's what our scraper does, but with websites!

### Where Do We Get Events From?

**Website:** [What's On Glasgow](https://www.whatsonglasgow.co.uk/events/)

This website is like the biggest event bulletin board in Glasgow. It has:
- Live music shows
- Comedy nights
- Theatre performances
- Food festivals
- Art exhibitions
- And much more!

### How Does the Scraper Work?

Let's break it down step-by-step:

#### Step 1: Go to the Website
```python
# Like opening a web browser and typing a URL
response = httpx.get('https://www.whatsonglasgow.co.uk/events/')
```

The scraper pretends to be a web browser so the website lets it visit.

#### Step 2: Read the HTML Code
Every website is made of HTML code. It looks like this:
```html
<div class="event">
  <h4>Amazing Comedy Night</h4>
  <p>Date: 26th October 2025</p>
  <a href="/venue/kings-theatre">King's Theatre</a>
  <p>Come laugh with Glasgow's funniest comedians!</p>
</div>
```

Our scraper reads this code like reading a recipe!

#### Step 3: Find All the Events
We use a tool called **BeautifulSoup** (yes, that's its real name! 🍲).

```python
# Find all event links on the page
event_links = soup.find_all('a', href=re.compile(r'/event/\d+-'))
```

This is like saying: "Find me all the links that look like event pages!"

#### Step 4: Extract Information from Each Event

For each event, we collect:

1. **Title**: "Amazing Comedy Night"
2. **Date**: "26th October 2025" 
   - We look for patterns like "25th October" or "DD/MM/YYYY"
3. **Venue**: "King's Theatre"
   - We find links that mention the venue
4. **Description**: "Come laugh with Glasgow's funniest comedians!"
5. **Category**: "COMEDY" 
   - Categories are usually in UPPERCASE
6. **URL**: Full link to the event page

#### Step 5: Clean Up the Data

Sometimes websites have:
- Extra spaces: "  Comedy  Night  " → "Comedy Night"
- Duplicate events listed twice
- Weird characters: "It's" instead of "It's"

We clean all of this up!

#### Step 6: Save to Cache

Instead of asking the website for events every single time, we save them in a file called `events_cache.csv`.

Think of it like taking a photo of the bulletin board so you don't have to walk there every 5 minutes!

### The Cache System

**What is a Cache?**

A cache is like a notebook where you write down answers to save time.

- **Without cache**: Every time someone asks "What events are on?", we visit the website (slow! ⏰)
- **With cache**: We check our notebook first! Only visit the website once per hour (fast! ⚡)

**Our Cache File: `events_cache.csv`**

This is a spreadsheet file that looks like:
```
Title,Date,Venue,Description,Category,URL
"Comedy Night","26th Oct 2025","King's Theatre","Funny show!","COMEDY","https://..."
"Rock Concert","26th Oct 2025","Barrowland","Live music!","MUSIC","https://..."
```

We update this file:
- Every hour automatically
- When someone manually runs the scraper

### Code Files

1. **`event_scraper.py`** (335 lines)
   - Main scraping logic
   - `GlasgowEventScraper` class handles everything
   - Methods: `get_todays_events()`, `filter_events_by_category()`, etc.

2. **`events_cache.csv`**
   - Stores all scraped events
   - Updated periodically
   - Currently has ~300+ events

## 🌤️ The Weather System - Should You Bring an Umbrella?

### Why Weather Matters

Imagine planning an outdoor concert, but it's pouring rain! ☔
Or choosing an indoor museum when it's beautiful sunshine outside! ☀️

Our app checks the weather and helps you pick events that match!

### Which Weather API Do We Use?

**API:** [wttr.in](https://wttr.in)

This is a FREE weather service that gives us:
- Current temperature in Glasgow
- Weather condition (sunny, cloudy, rainy, etc.)
- Hourly forecast for the whole day
- All without needing a special key or paying money!

### How Do We Get Weather Data?

#### Step 1: Ask for Glasgow's Weather

```python
response = fetch('https://wttr.in/Glasgow,UK?format=j1')
```

The `?format=j1` means "give me JSON data" (a format computers understand easily).

#### Step 2: Understand the Response

The API sends back data like this:
```json
{
  "current_condition": [{
    "temp_C": "8",
    "weatherCode": "353",
    "weatherDesc": [{"value": "Light rain shower"}],
    "precipMM": "0.3"
  }],
  "weather": [{
    "hourly": [
      {
        "time": "300",
        "tempC": "6",
        "weatherCode": "353",
        "weatherDesc": [{"value": "Light rain shower"}]
      },
      {
        "time": "600",
        "tempC": "7",
        "weatherCode": "176",
        "weatherDesc": [{"value": "Patchy rain nearby"}]
      }
    ]
  }]
}
```

#### Step 3: Translate Weather Codes to Emojis

Weather codes are numbers that represent conditions:
- `113` = Clear/Sunny → ☀️ (day) or 🌙 (night)
- `116` = Partly cloudy → ⛅
- `119-122` = Cloudy/Overcast → ☁️
- `353` = Light rain → 🌧️
- `338-395` = Snow → ❄️

Our code converts these numbers to emojis you can understand instantly!

```typescript
function getWeatherEmoji(code: number, isRaining: boolean, isNight: boolean) {
  if (isRaining) return '🌧️'
  if (code === 113) return isNight ? '🌙' : '☀️'
  if (code === 116) return isNight ? '☁️' : '⛅'
  // ... and so on
}
```

#### Step 4: Detect if It's Actually Raining

Instead of just trusting weather codes, we also check:

1. **Description keywords**: Does it say "rain", "drizzle", "shower"?
2. **Precipitation amount**: Is `precipMM > 0.1`? (Is actual rain falling?)

```typescript
const rainKeywords = ['rain', 'drizzle', 'shower', 'sleet', 'snow', 'thunder']
const isRaining = rainKeywords.some(keyword => 
  description.toLowerCase().includes(keyword)
) || precipMM > 0.1
```

This way we don't accidentally mark cloudy weather as rain!

### The Weather Banner

At the top of the website, you see:

**When it's raining:**
```
🌧️ 8°C  Light rain shower
☂️ It's raining! We recommend checking out indoor events today.

[3 AM]  [6 AM]  [9 AM]  [12 PM]  [3 PM]  [6 PM]  [9 PM]
  🌧️      🌧️      🌧️      🌧️      🌧️     🌧️     ☁️
  6°      6°      9°      10°     9°     8°     7°
```

**When it's sunny:**
```
☀️ 18°C  Clear
🌟 Perfect weather for outdoor events!

[3 AM]  [6 AM]  [9 AM]  [12 PM]  [3 PM]  [6 PM]  [9 PM]
  🌙      🌙      ☀️      ☀️      ☀️     ⛅     🌙
  12°     11°     15°     18°     17°    14°    12°
```

## 🤖 The AI Chat Assistant - Your Smart Friend

### What Can the AI Do?

The AI assistant is like talking to a friend who knows EVERYTHING about Glasgow events!

**Conversation Example:**

```
You: Hi!
AI: Hi! I'm here to help you plan your night out! 
    Are you going out alone, or with friends?

You: With 4 friends
AI: Awesome! What kind of vibe are you looking for tonight? 
    (e.g., energetic, chill, artsy, social)

You: Something energetic and fun
AI: Great choice! What's your budget per person? 💰

You: £25 each
AI: Perfect! Let me find the best events for your group... 🎉

    Based on your preferences, here are my top 3 recommendations:
    
    1. 🔥 Comedy Club Night at The Stand
       - Score: 92/100 (Hot Pick!)
       - £18 per person
       - Perfect for groups, super energetic
       
    2. ⭐ Live Music at King Tut's
       - Score: 85/100 (Top Rated!)
       - £15 per person
       - Rock band, high energy
    
    Would you like more details about any of these?
```

### Which AI Do We Use?

**AI Model:** OpenAI GPT-4o-mini

This is like ChatGPT's younger sibling - fast, smart, and perfect for conversations!

### How Does the AI Work?

#### Step 1: Understanding What You Want

The AI goes through stages to collect info:

1. **Stage: Greeting**
   - Says hello
   - Asks if you're alone or with friends

2. **Stage: Mood**
   - Asks what vibe you want (energetic, chill, romantic, etc.)
   - Can understand natural language: "I want something artsy and cozy"

3. **Stage: Group Size**
   - How many people?
   - Adjusts recommendations based on this

4. **Stage: Budget**
   - How much can you spend?
   - Only suggests events you can afford

5. **Stage: Complete**
   - Has all info
   - Generates recommendations

#### Step 2: The AI's "Memory"

The AI has a special "system prompt" - instructions it always follows:

```python
system_prompt = """
You are a helpful assistant for planning nights out in Glasgow.

RULES:
1. Be friendly and enthusiastic
2. Only recommend events from the provided CSV list
3. Consider the current weather when suggesting events
4. Take budget seriously - don't suggest things they can't afford
5. Match the mood/vibe they requested

CURRENT WEATHER: {weather_description}
If it's raining, prioritize indoor events!

AVAILABLE EVENTS:
{csv_events_list}
"""
```

This is like giving the AI a job description and telling it what to do!

#### Step 3: Making Smart Recommendations

The AI uses the **NightOut Score** (we'll explain this next!) to pick the best events.

It considers:
- Your mood preferences
- Weather conditions
- Budget constraints
- Group size
- Event scores

#### Step 4: Natural Conversations

The AI can understand different ways of saying things:

- "I'm looking for something chill" = relaxed mood
- "Me and 3 mates" = 4 people total
- "Around twenty quid" = £20 budget
- "Artsy and cozy" = art + relaxed mood

### The GPT + Google Maps Method

**Our Smart Recommendation System:**

The AI uses a two-step process to give you the best recommendations:

**Step 1: GPT Recommends Events from CSV**
- GPT analyzes your preferences (mood, budget, group size)
- Recommends ONLY real events from our scraped CSV file
- No fake venues or made-up events!

**Step 2: Google Maps Integration**
- For each recommended event, we automatically generate a Google Maps link
- Shows exact venue location in Glasgow
- One-click navigation to the venue

```python
ONLY_CSV_RECOMMENDATIONS = True  # Always true!
```

**Example Flow:**

1. You: "I want something fun with 3 friends, £25 each"
2. GPT: Analyzes CSV events matching "fun" + "£25" budget
3. GPT: Recommends "Comedy Night at The Stand" (from CSV)
4. System: Generates Google Maps link: `https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=The+Stand+Glasgow`
5. You see:
   - **Event Title**: Comedy Night at The Stand
   - **Learn More** button → Event details page
   - **View Location** button → Google Maps with venue location

This is like giving the AI a menu and saying "only recommend dishes on this menu, and show me directions to each restaurant!"

### Code Files

1. **`backend/backend3.py`**
   - FastAPI server for the chat
   - `/chat` endpoint handles conversations
   - Manages conversation state (what stage you're on)
   - Calls OpenAI API

     - Generates Google Maps URLs: `https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query={venue}+Glasgow`
     - Returns formatted events with both event URL and maps URL
     - Example:
       ```python
       formatted_event = {
           'title': 'Comedy Night',
           'venue': 'The Stand',
           'link': 'https://whatsonglasgow.co.uk/event/...',  # Event page
           'maps_url': 'https://google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=The+Stand+Glasgow'  # Venue location
       }
       ```

## 🏆 The NightOut Score - Our Special Scoring System

### What is the NightOut Score?

Remember in school when teachers give grades (A+, B, C)? 

Our NightOut Score does the same for events! It's a number from 0-100 that tells you how good an event is for YOU right now.

**Score Ranges:**
- **85-100**: 🔥 Hot Pick (Amazing! Don't miss this!)
- **70-84**: ⭐ Top Rated (Really good choice!)
- **55-69**: 👍 Good Choice (Solid option)
- **0-54**: 📍 Available (It's okay)

### The Team14 Activity Metric Formula

This is OUR custom invention - we created our own scoring system!

The score is calculated using **4 factors** with different importance (weights):

```
Total Score = (Weather × 40%) + (Time × 30%) + (Category × 20%) + (Venue × 10%)
```

Let's explain each part:

---

### Factor 1: Weather Compatibility (40% of score)

**This is the MOST important factor because weather really affects your night!**

**The Logic:**

If it's raining:
- Indoor events (theatres, museums, clubs) = 95/100 ✅
- Outdoor events (festivals, parks) = 30/100 ❌

If it's nice weather:
- Outdoor events = 95/100 ✅
- Indoor events = 60/100 (still okay)

If it's neutral (cloudy, not too cold):
- Indoor events = 70/100
- Outdoor events = 55/100

**How We Detect Indoor vs Outdoor:**

```typescript
const indoorKeywords = [
  'theatre', 'museum', 'gallery', 'cinema', 'comedy', 'club',
  'bar', 'pub', 'restaurant', 'bowling', 'arcade'
]

// If event category has any of these words, it's indoor!
```

**Example Calculation:**

Event: "Comedy Show at The Stand"
- Category: Comedy → Indoor event ✅
- Weather: Raining ☔
- Weather Score: **95/100** 🔥

---

### Factor 2: Time Relevance (30% of score)

**Events happening SOON are more valuable than events next week!**

**The Logic:**

- Event starting in 0-3 hours: 100/100 (Happening very soon!)
- Event starting in 3-6 hours: 85/100 (Tonight!)
- Event starting in 6-12 hours: 65/100 (Later tonight)
- Event starting in 12-24 hours: 40/100 (Tomorrow)
- Event starting in 24+ hours: 25/100 (Future)
- Event already started/passed: 20/100 (You missed it!)

**Example Calculation:**

Current time: 6:00 PM
Event starts: 8:00 PM (2 hours away)
Time Score: **100/100** ⚡

---

### Factor 3: Category Appeal (20% of score)

**Popular nightlife categories get higher scores!**

**Popular Categories:**
- Music, Nightlife, Live Music, Club, Bar, Concert
- Comedy, Theatre, Food & Drink, Party, DJ

**The Logic:**

- Event has popular category: 85/100 ⭐
- Event has regular category: 60/100 ✓
- Event has no category listed: 40/100 ❓

**Example Calculation:**

Event: "Stand-Up Comedy Night"
Category: Comedy → Popular! ✨
Category Score: **85/100**

---

### Factor 4: Venue Popularity (10% of score)

**Well-known venues or descriptive events get a small boost!**

**Popular Venue Keywords:**
- club, arena, theatre, hall, bar, pub, live, festival

**The Logic:**

- Venue/title has popular keyword: 80/100 🎭
- Regular venue: 50/100 🏢

**Example Calculation:**

Event: "Jazz Night at King's Theatre"
Venue: "King's Theatre" → has "theatre" keyword
Venue Score: **80/100**

---

### Putting It All Together

Let's score a real event!

**Event:** "Comedy Show at The Stand"
- Date: Tonight, 8 PM (2 hours away)
- Category: Comedy (indoor)
- Venue: The Stand Comedy Club
- Weather: Raining ☔

**Step-by-Step Calculation:**

1. **Weather Score:** 95/100
   - Indoor event during rain = Perfect! 🔥

2. **Time Score:** 100/100
   - Starting in 2 hours = Happening soon! ⚡

3. **Category Score:** 85/100
   - Comedy is popular nightlife! ⭐

4. **Venue Score:** 80/100
   - "Stand" and "Comedy Club" = Well-known! 🎭

**Final Score:**
```
Total = (95 × 0.40) + (100 × 0.30) + (85 × 0.20) + (80 × 0.10)
      = 38 + 30 + 17 + 8
      = 93/100 🔥 HOT PICK!
```

**Badge:** 🔥 Hot Pick
